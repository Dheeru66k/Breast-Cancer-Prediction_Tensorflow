# Breast-Cancer-Prediction_Tensorflow
Predicting the person having Breast cancer or not using Neural Networks and TensorFlow


In this project I have written two models using Neural Networks and Tensorflow framework.
Added Dense layers with ReLu for inner and sigmoid for output layers. Used "Binary cross entropy" and "adam" optimizer for both the models with a batch size 64.
One model with Dropiut layers and one without, trained the data for both the models and visualized the results.

The model with Dropoout layers performed better.
